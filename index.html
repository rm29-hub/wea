            <h2 class="act1Title">ACTIVITY 1</h2>
            <p>In this activity,I encountered export/import, objects, destructuring, template literals, and arrow functions. These concepts introduced various ways to share code, organize data, and streamline coding practices, offering a comprehensive understanding of modern JavaScript development techniques.However, there's still room for deeper understanding.</p><br/>
            <p>I found it challenging in this activity to grasp arrow functions, especially when working with the image.js file.  It seems I misunderstood certain aspects of their implementation or usage.</p><br/>
        </div>
        <div class="sec2">
            <h2 class="act2Title">ACTIVITY 2</h2>
            <p> In this activity, I learned about export and import, object, destructuring, template literal, and arrow function. Export/import helps us share code between different JavaScript files. The export will let you bring out functions or data from your js file to your main js file, and the main js file will accept it by using import. Objects are similar to arrays but use curly brackets to hold different types of data. Destructuring is one way to access the object, other way to access it is using dot notation. Template literals let us create dynamic strings easily. Lastly, arrow function it is feature of ES6, it is shorter than the regular function and it has arrow "=>" sign.</p><br/>
            <p> What I found challenging in this activity was understanding arrow functions, especially when working with the image.js file but our second discussion cleared things up for me. The picture on the left is the visual guide for how the activity should appear.</p>

        <div class="sec3">
            <h2 class="act3Title">ACTIVITY 3</h2>
            <p> In this activity, I learned  how to organize HTML file to create different sections within the application, such as the Leaderboard, Rules, and Game Setup. Exploring CSS techniques to design and style. </p><br/>
            <p> I found ensuring consistency in the design across all sections challenging.</p>
